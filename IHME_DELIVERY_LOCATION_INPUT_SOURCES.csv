Data collection took place in two phases: in the southern states from April-July and in the northern states from July-October. Three questionnaires were used: a household questionnaire, an individual questionnaire, and a service availability questionnaire.
The sample was taken from the national master sample for the 1987 and 1992 National Integrated Survey of Households (NISH) program. A total of 299 clusters were selected including 132 urban and 167 rural. Of the 9,998 households selected, a total of 8,999 were interviewed. Out of an eligible 9,200 women age 15-49 years, reproductive histories were collected for 8,781 of them, as well as data on the health of 8,113 of their children under the age of 5-years.

A women's questionnaire included topics such as reproductive history, use of family planning methods, maternal care, breastfeeding, child vaccinations, and marriage and sexual activity.
A men's questionnaire that covered much of the same subject matter as the women's questionnaire, but was shorter because it lacked sections on reproductive history, maternal and child health, and nutrition.
